# DATA-WRANGLING-Open-Street-Map

In this project we will work with the dataset of the city of New York to check for the quality of the data. The inputs in this dataset were made by people, which means that most likely there are errors to correct. We will analyze a sample of the dataset because the original one is too large (2+ GB).

In the upcoming cells, I will explain the code I'm using and what the results mean. I will provide the explanations in this notebook, so that the entire process is more understandable.
